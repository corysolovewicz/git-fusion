# Git Fusion repo configuration file.
#
# Contains settings that affect a single Git Fusion repo.
#
# See also global configuration file //P4GF_DEPOT/p4gf_config. This repo
# configuration file can override settings from the global configuration file.
#
# Git Fusion creates this file during initialization. Git Fusion reads this
# file once at the start of each Git operation. Git Fusion writes to this file
# often. You can write to this file: Git Fusion retains your edited values but
# not edited comments or formatting.
#
# [@repo]
#       One section for repo-wide settings.
#
#   description:
#       A brief description of this repo which will be returned by @list
#
#   charset:
#       Charset used for this repo.  Used when working with a unicode enabled
#       Perforce server.
#       See 'p4 help charset' for a list of possible values.
#
#   enable-git-branch-creation:
#       Create branches in Perforce when copying from Git?
#
#       yes (default)
#           Yes, create a new branch of Perforce depot file hierarchy for each
#           copied branch of Git workspace history. This includes task branches
#           which become 'anonymous' branches in Perforce.
#
#       no
#           No, do not create any branches. When copying from Git to Perforce,
#           reject any push of a new branch not already described in the
#           repo's config file. When copying from Perforce to Git, copy
#           Perforce integrations or merges from other file hierarchies as
#           edits to files, not Git merge commits.
#
#   enable-git-merge-commits:
#       Allow Git merge commits to be pushed to Perforce?
#
#       yes (default)
#           Yes, Git merge commits may be pushed to Perforce, and will appear
#           as integrations between branches in Perforce.
#
#       no
#           Disallow Git merge commits. Integrations between branches in
#           Perforce can still be performed using Perforce clients.
#
#   enable-git-submodules:
#       Allow Git submodules to be pushed to Perforce?
#
#       yes (default)
#           Yes, Git submodules may be pushed to Perforce.
#
#       no
#           Disallow Git submodules from being introduced into Git Fusion.
#           If any submodules have already been pushed to Git Fusion, they
#           will be left intact and be reproduced via clone/pull.
#
#   ignore-author-permissions:
#       Consider whose permissions when copying from Git to Perforce?
#       Who must have 'write' permission to a file being changed?
#
#       yes
#           Require only the pusher to have Perforce write permission.
#
#       no (default)
#           Require both Git author and pusher to both have write permission.
#
#   change-owner:
#       Determines who the Perforce change owner will be.
#
#       author (default)
#           Assigns the change owner to that of the Git commit author.
#
#       pusher
#           Assigns the change owner to that of the Git pusher.
#
#   preflight-commit:
#       Custom 'git push' commit filter.
#
#       none (default)
#           No filter.
#
#       pass <msg>
#           Permit all commits (that Git Fusion also permits).
#
#       fail <msg>
#           Reject all commits.
#
#       cmd <args>
#           Run cmd. If cmd returns exit code 0, permit commit.
#           Exit code non-0: reject commit.
#
# [<git-fusion-branch-id>]
#       One section for each branch known to Git Fusion. Describes a mapping
#       between a single Git branch of workspace history and a single Perforce
#       branch of file hierarchy.
#
#       Section name can be same as git-branch-name or a Perforce branch name.
#       Section name must be unique within this Git Fusion repo.
#
#   git-branch-name:
#       Name of the Git branch, such as "master".
#
#   view:
#       A Perforce view specification that maps Perforce depot paths (left
#       side) to Git work tree paths (right side).
#
#       Used internally as a Perforce workspace/client view mapping. All
#       Perforce workspace/client view mapping operations permitted,
#       including multiple lines, exclusion (minus/-) lines, overlay
#       (plus/+) lines.
