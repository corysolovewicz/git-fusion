#  Git Fusion os environment configuration file.
#  The optional shell environment variable P4GF_CONFIG contains the path
#  to a file which configures the Git Fusion runtime environment.
#  If P4GF_CONFIG does not exist Git Fusion will inherit its runtime environment:
#  A valid P4GF_CONFIG contains values to be set for the runtime os environment for a single Git Fusion instance.
#  Mutiple Git Fusion instances on a single system require unique values for P4GF_CONFIG
#  because P4GF_HOME must be unique per GF instance
#
#
#  All non-P4 shell environment settings specified will be set for Git Fusion.
#  You may unset a non-P4 shell variable by setting to 'unset'.
#  All P4 environment variables not explicitly set will be unset for the Git Fusion process.
#  P4GF_CONFIG is always unset as this file is intended to override it.
#  
#  The following shell variables may not be set here:
#    PATH
#    LANG
#    P4CONFIG
